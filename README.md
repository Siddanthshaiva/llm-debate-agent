# AI Debate Simulator

## Overview

The AI Debate Simulator is an innovative project that leverages advanced language models to simulate dynamic debates on various topics. This system incorporates multiple AI agents playing different roles, including debaters, a moderator, judges, and audience members, to create a comprehensive and engaging debate experience.

## Features

- **AI Debaters**: Two AI agents argue for and against a given topic.
- **AI Moderator**: Guides the debate, introduces rounds, and ensures fair discussion.
- **AI Judge**: Evaluates the debate and determines a winner based on argument quality and persuasiveness.
- **AI Audience**: Simulates audience voting to gauge public opinion on the debate.
- **Scoring System**: Provides an objective scoring mechanism for each round of the debate.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements
